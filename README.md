### DailyReport
This one's a super simple console application that just asks the user questions and does some super basic variable storage. No Try/Catch method in it yet.

### Math_and_Comparison
Another super simple console app. Takes hourly rate and weeks worked, uses an extra method and calls it... nothing fancy here but just more practice.

### Boolean_Logic
Console app that takes some answers in, applies some boolean logic, gives various responses based on the supplied answers.

###	Branching_Assignment
Console app that takes in some user input, manipulates it, but branches based on logic.

### Boolean_Do_While
Another console app that takes a user input, passes it through some regex and a boolean loop and then determines whether or not we're good to go.
