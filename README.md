### DailyReport
This one's a super simple console application that just asks the user questions and does some super basic variable storage. No Try/Catch method in it yet.

### Math_and_Comparison
Another super simple console app. Takes hourly rate and weeks worked, uses an extra method and calls it... nothing fancy here but just more practice.
