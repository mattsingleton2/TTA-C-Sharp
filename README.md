**Basic C# Projects from The Tech Academy**

### DailyReport
This one's a super simple console application that just asks the user questions and does some super basic variable storage. No Try/Catch method in it yet.

### Math_and_Comparison
Another super simple console app. Takes hourly rate and weeks worked, uses an extra method and calls it... nothing fancy here but just more practice.

### Boolean_Logic
Console app that takes some answers in, applies some boolean logic, gives various responses based on the supplied answers.

###	Branching_Assignment
Console app that takes in some user input, manipulates it, but branches based on logic.

### Boolean_Do_While
Another console app that takes a user input, passes it through some regex and a boolean loop and then determines whether or not we're good to go.

### ArraysAndLists
Quick project to show utilization and index search for arrays and lists.

### Iterations
Practice on iterating through objects.

### Blackjack
A project to play Blackjack in C#! 

### Method_Calls
A quick bit of practice for instantiating objects from classes and calling any methods attributed with them.

### Methods_And_Classes
Practicing with class inheritance, super class methods and how things pass around.

### Class_Practice 
Tested out some various class instantiations. Used a static class and understood how those relate to things like the Math class in C#. No object-instantiation method-access.

### Exceptions
Work with Try/Catch. Learned how to grab exceptions and display custom messages for those or log them to a console (or db in the future.)
